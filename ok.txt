MC Sessional Task (1 june 2021)

Childhood App (مدكر الطفولة | Devpost)

In this day and age it is very important for muslims to teach their childern about islam as there life has become so busy and material. And the best way to teach childrens is through games.
In this app small games are created which in terms open rewards like duaas and ayaats.

What can I implement in my project from this? 
If I could have known about this project I would have used it for my previous projects and assignments but now I am working on the education related system. And I can uses its reward system idea in my project that every hurdle I cross I receive a reward in form or unlocking special ayaat, surat or duaa


How much of the task can you do in this application?
I wish I could know about these projects before we select our Term project. I could have chosen a similar idea to this the app. 
As per learnings in that course me and my team could implement the same UI. But instead of creating small game for children I could create educational system for adults.
